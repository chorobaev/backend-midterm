# Customer Service
Customer Service is a spring boot demo web application 
which is built for educational purpose.<br> 
I hope its interface is enough intuitive and user friendly.

Follow [this](http://165.22.75.211:8080/customer-service) link to check it out.

**Note**: _As the project deployed to a tomcat server, 
its home directory is_ `./customer-service`.

Username: `admin` <br>
